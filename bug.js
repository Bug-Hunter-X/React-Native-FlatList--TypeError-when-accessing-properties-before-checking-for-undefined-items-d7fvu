In React Native, a seemingly innocuous error can arise when working with FlatList and its renderItem function. If the renderItem function attempts to access a property of an item in the data array before checking if the item exists, it can lead to a runtime error, specifically a TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property'). This often happens when the data array is initially empty or when a network request is still pending.
